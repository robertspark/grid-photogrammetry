# Grid Photogrammetry

[robertspark.github.io/grid-photogrammetry/](https://robertspark.github.io/grid-photogrammetry/)

the changes to the original fork of this grid waypoint planner is the addition of more recent camera information (DJI Mini 3 & 4 Pro and Mavic 3 Cameras)


## Reference

I used the original github repository of [afbayonac.github.io/grid-photogrammetry/](https://afbayonac.github.io/grid-photogrammetry/)

afbayona used the reference of [Mission Planer](https://github.com/smt5965/mission-planner-/blob/ddaf805a204aa4f89d716ebc3d10b97bbef92bee/ExtLibs/Utilities/Grid.cs#L315); [ancient.land](https://ancient.land) to create the original github posting (thank you very very much!!!!!)

I would just like to add some new camera profiles to this great piece of work such as the Mini 3 Pro, Mini 3, Mini 4 Pro, and Mavic 3, Mavic 3 Classic, Mavic 3 Cine, Mavic 3 Pro and Mavic Enterprise Drons (3E 3T and 3M), etc..... see where we get to 

feel free to post on this litchi forum and I'll add whatever you provide
